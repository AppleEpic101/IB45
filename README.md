  The IB PREDICT DP Predicted Score Calculator is a tool designed for both students and teachers. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate - simply use the dropdown menu and select the appropriate course. Users can input options for Groups 1 through 6, as well as TOK+EE. Results can be found in the table, displaying information such as total points, detailed point distribution, diploma status, etc.

## Message

With IB Exams currently ongoing, I would like to remind everyone of the #1 IB Score Calculator for students in the IBDP. Since our launch in June 2023, we have had over 20,000+ unique users use the app. 
Since then, we have made extensive changes to our site. The most notable of which is our individual subject page (HERE) where you can navigate to view course descriptions, enter assessment score, and view past grade boundary bands. We have recently updated our site to include May 2023 grade boundaries.

On top of that, we have added predicted mark probability graphs, which can help you get a better idea of your grade in the context of all the past grade boundaries. Make of that information as you well - since a disproportionate amount of grade boundaries come from the COVID times. 


If you catch any errors, have any question or suggestions, make sure to email us at admin@ibpredict.org. As for now, we will continue maintain the site after every IB exam session to include the updated grade boundaries and syllabi changes.
