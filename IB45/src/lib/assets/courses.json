The course aims at developing an understanding of factors that contribute to the production and reception of literature—the creativity of writers and readers, the nature of their interaction with their respective contexts and with literary tradition, the ways in which language can give rise to meaning and/or effect, and the performative and transformative potential of literary creation and response. Through close analysis of a range of literary texts in a number of literary forms and from different times and places, students will consider their own interpretations as well as the critical perspectives of others, to explore how such positions are shaped by cultural belief systems and to negotiate meanings for texts.",

Latin and Classical Greek are separate courses, but they share the same syllabus and assessment criteria. The Diploma Programme courses in classical languages provide an opportunity for students to explore the languages, literatures and cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. These ancient civilizations have played a vital part in shaping many modern societies and cultures. The languages themselves are versatile and finely structured, and have had a major influence on the development of most modern European languages. The rich and varied literatures of Greece and Rome have left their mark on almost every genre of modern writing. The study of classical languages gives important insights into the cultures that produced them, and therefore leads to a greater understanding of contemporary languages, literature and cultures. Fundamentally, the study of classical languages trains the mind, developing skills of critical thought, memory and close analysis, as well as an appreciation of the beauty and power of language. Other classical languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and Hebrew, which have all made important contributions to modern societies, are beyond the scope of this guide. In the classical languages it is a fundamental principle that the texts be studied in their original language. Linguistic skills lie at the heart of the courses, since it is through a deep understanding of the workings of a language that true intellectual contact can be made with the peoples of the past.

		"description": "Art history is the study of the rich heritage of visual arts produced by human societies. This production, ranging from painting, sculpture, architecture, design, photography, and applied arts to costume and body art, has found expression in human cultures from the earliest times and has been determined by a range of functions. The art historian is concerned with the formal appreciation of these works and the understanding of their meaning within the culture that produced them, as well as the relationships between one culture and another. Visual literacy is particularly relevant in an age when we have unprecedented access and exposure to images. As part of the IB Diploma programme, art history forms an option in group 3, individuals and societies. The discipline is fundamentally about how individuals and social groups have responded to and represented aspects of their world and experience, creating a visual response that is simultaneously that of the individual and their society. The works produced may have meaning for different sections of that society. Works are studied from a variety of approaches, which comprise the core curriculum of the syllabus. Interpretations of the art of the past are constantly changing as new evidence comes to light in art historical research, as cultural values change, and as developments occur in contemporary art. The subject requires a critical analysis of documentary and theoretical sources. To some extent, our view of the art of other cultures is necessarily conditioned by our own cultural attitudes, but by trying to understand how these works were originally intended or how societies have viewed other cultures, those societies are brought closer to us, and our own appreciation of the works is enhanced.",

It achieves this by exploring the interconnectedness of individuals, society, and the environment across multiple dimensions: physical, political, social, economic, religious, technological, and cultural. Both history and geography components of the curriculum promote the use of investigative methods to address overarching and intricate inquiries. In the history segment, students are urged to contemplate the role of historians and embrace diverse interpretations of past events. In the realm of geography, students are guided to recognize how Brazil's physical landscape has evolved due to socio-economic processes. Moreover, they are prompted to grasp the interplay between human beings and the natural environment. The coursework also prompts students to reflect on geographical challenges that may necessitate interdisciplinary approaches. Furthermore, the curriculum guides students through a learning journey that fosters an understanding and appreciation of Brazilian culture. The evaluation of this cultural awareness is seamlessly integrated into the assessment of historical and geographical aspects of the course.",

At the heart of economic theory is the problem of scarcity. Owing to scarcity, choices have to be made. The economics course, at both SL and HL, uses economic theories, models and key concepts to examine the ways in which these choices are made: at the level of producers and consumers in individual markets (microeconomics); at the level of the government and the national economy (macroeconomics); and at an international level, where countries are becoming increasingly interdependent (the global economy). The DP economics course allows students to explore these models, theories and key concepts, and apply them, using empirical data, through the examination of six real-world issues. Through their own inquiry, students will be able to appreciate both the values and limitations of economic models in explaining real-world economic behaviour and outcomes. By focusing on the six real-world issues through the nine key concepts (scarcity, choice, efficiency, equity, economic well-being, sustainability, change, interdependence and intervention), students of the economics course will develop the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes that will encourage them to act responsibly as global citizens.",

It seeks to identify trends and patterns in these interactions. It also investigates the way in which people adapt and respond to change and evaluates actual and possible management strategies associated with such change. Geography describes and helps to explain the similarities and differences between different places, on a variety of scales and from different perspectives. Geography as a subject is distinctive in its spatial dimension and occupies a middle ground between social or human sciences and natural sciences. The course integrates physical, environmental, and human geography, and students acquire elements of both socio-economic and scientific methodologies. Geography takes advantage of its position to examine relevant concepts and ideas from a wide variety of disciplines, helping students develop life skills and have an appreciation of, and respect for, alternative approaches, viewpoints, and ideas. Students at both SL and HL are presented with a common core and optional geographic themes. HL students also study the HL core extension. Although the skills and activity of studying geography are common to all students, HL students are required to acquire a further body of knowledge, to demonstrate critical evaluation, and to further synthesize the concepts in the HL extension.",

The contribution and the interaction of the three approaches are understood through the four options in the course, focusing on areas of applied psychology: abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, health psychology, and the psychology of relationships. The options provide an opportunity to take what is learned from the study of the approaches to psychology and apply it to specific lines of inquiry. Psychologists employ a range of research methods, both qualitative and quantitative, to test their observations and hypotheses. DP psychology promotes an understanding of the various approaches to research and how they are used to critically reflect on the evidence as well as assist in the design, implementation, analysis, and evaluation of the students' investigations.

Social and cultural anthropology is distinct from other social sciences in its research tradition of participant observation and in-depth, empirical study of social groups. Areas of anthropological inquiry in this course are: belonging; classifying the world; communication, expression and technology; conflict; development; health, illness, and healing; movement, time, and space; production, exchange, and consumption; and the body. These areas are explored through the key anthropological concepts of belief and knowledge, change, culture, identity, materiality, power, social relations, society, and symbolism. The course engages students with the concepts, methods, language, and theories of the discipline. At the heart is the practice of anthropologists and the insights they produce in the form of ethnographic material. Through authentic anthropological practice, students engage with anthropological approaches and develop critical, reflexive knowledge.

Inquiry and problem-solving are at the heart of the subject. DP design technology requires the use of the design cycle as a tool, which provides the methodology used to structure the inquiry and analysis of problems, the development of feasible solutions, and the testing and evaluation of the solution. A solution can be defined as a model, prototype, product, or system that students have developed independently. DP design technology achieves a high level of design literacy by enabling students to develop critical-thinking and design skills, which they can apply in a practical context. While designing may take various forms, it will involve the selective application of knowledge within an ethical framework.",

As a result of studying this course, students will become equipped with the ability to recognize and evaluate the impact of our complex system of societies on the natural world. The interdisciplinary nature of the DP course requires a broad skill set from students, including the ability to perform research and investigations, participation in philosophical discussion and problem-solving. The course requires a systems approach to environmental understanding and promotes holistic thinking about environmental issues.

This exchange is not a new phenomenon but it has accelerated in recent times with the development of information and communication technologies. Indeed, the idea that science is a Western invention is a myth—many of the foundations of modern-day science were laid many centuries before by Arabic, Indian, and Chinese civilizations, among others. Teachers are encouraged to emphasize this contribution in their teaching of various topics, perhaps through the use of timeline websites. The scientific method in its widest sense, with its emphasis on peer review, open-mindedness, and freedom of thought, transcends politics, religion, gender, and nationality. Where appropriate within certain topics, the syllabus details sections in the group 4 guides contain links illustrating the international aspects of science. On an organizational level, many international bodies now exist to promote science. United Nations bodies such as UNESCO, UNEP, and WMO, where science plays a prominent part, are well known, but in addition, there are hundreds of international bodies representing every branch of science. The facilities for large-scale research in, for example, particle physics and the Human Genome Project are expensive, and only joint ventures involving funding from many countries allow this to take place. The data from such research is shared by scientists worldwide. Group 4 teachers and students are encouraged to access the extensive websites and databases of these international scientific organizations to enhance their appreciation of the international dimension.",

Despite the exciting and extraordinary development of ideas throughout the history of physics, observations remain essential to the very core of the subject. Models are developed to try to understand observations, and these themselves can become theories that attempt to explain the observations. Besides helping us better understand the natural world, physics gives us the ability to alter our environments. This raises the issue of the impact of physics on society, the moral and ethical dilemmas, and the social, economic, and environmental implications of the work of physicists. By studying physics, students should become aware of how scientists work and communicate with each other. While the scientific method may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the emphasis on a practical approach through experimental work that characterizes the subject.

It brings together literary analysis, based on close reading, critical writing, and discussion, with practical and aesthetic elements of theatre. In this course, students engage with a range of literary works, perform dramatic texts, and transform texts into realized performances. The course is grounded in knowledge, skills, and processes associated with the individual disciplines while developing interdisciplinary understandings generated from the interactions between literature and performance. Literature and performance is only available as a standard level (SL) course. Literature and performance is one of the three Diploma Programme (DP) courses grounded in the study of language and literature. Expectations of language usage, the level of analysis, and critical reflection are the same across the three studies in language and literature courses. Yet literature and performance is unique in that it asks students to integrate understandings from two disciplines to develop further insight and create products that would not be possible within the single disciplines alone. Investigating a literary text through performance provides students with a unique perspective on the text; likewise, grounding a theatrical performance in literary understanding provides students with deeper sensitivity to the process of theatre-making. As an interdisciplinary course, literature and performance shares the course aims of both studies in language and literature and arts subjects.",

In this way, the main focus of TOK is not on students acquiring new knowledge but on helping students to reflect on, and put into perspective, what they already know. TOK underpins and helps to unite the subjects that students encounter in the rest of their DP studies. It engages students in explicit reflection on how knowledge is arrived at in different disciplines and areas of knowledge, on what these areas have in common and the differences between them.",

		"description": "The extended essay is a compulsory, externally assessed piece of independent research into a topic chosen by the student and presented as a formal piece of academic writing. The extended essay is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery, and creativity while engaging students in personal research. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing of up to 4,000 words in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned, coherent, and appropriate manner. Students are guided through the process of research and writing by an assigned supervisor (a teacher in the school). All students undertake three mandatory reflection sessions with their supervisor, including a short interview, or viva voce, following the completion of the extended essay. Extended essay topics may be chosen from a list of approved DP subjects—normally one of the student’s six chosen subjects for the IB diploma or the world studies option. World studies provides students with the opportunity to carry out an in-depth interdisciplinary study of an issue of contemporary global significance, using two IB disciplines."

		"description": "Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the DP, designed to strengthen and extend students' personal and interpersonal learning from the Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Programme (MYP). CAS is organized around the three strands of creativity, activity, and service, each defined as follows: Creativity involves exploring and extending ideas leading to an original or interpretive product or performance. Activity encompasses physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle. Service entails collaborative and reciprocal engagement with the community in response to an authentic need. A CAS experience is a specific event in which the student engages with one or more of the three CAS strands. It can be a single event or an extended series of events. A CAS project is a collaborative series of sequential CAS experiences lasting at least one month. Typically, a student's CAS program combines planned/unplanned singular and ongoing experiences. All are valuable and may lead to personal development. However, a meaningful CAS program must be more than just a series of unplanned/singular experiences. Students must be involved in at least one CAS project during the program."
