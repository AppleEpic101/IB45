The business management course is designed to encourage the development of these attributes. Through the exploration of four interdisciplinary concepts: creativity, change, ethics, and sustainability, this course empowers students to explore these concepts from a business perspective. Business management focuses on business functions, management processes, and decision-making in contemporary contexts of strategic uncertainty. Students examine how business decisions are influenced by factors that are internal and external to an organization and how these decisions impact upon a range of internal and external stakeholders. Emphasis is placed on strategic decision-making and the operational business functions of human resource management, finance and accounts, marketing, and operations management. Business management is a challenging and dynamic discipline that more than meets the needs of our students growing and developing in a complex business environment.

At the heart of economic theory is the problem of scarcity. Owing to scarcity, choices have to be made. The economics course, at both SL and HL, uses economic theories, models and key concepts to examine the ways in which these choices are made: at the level of producers and consumers in individual markets (microeconomics); at the level of the government and the national economy (macroeconomics); and at an international level, where countries are becoming increasingly interdependent (the global economy). The DP economics course allows students to explore these models, theories and key concepts, and apply them, using empirical data, through the examination of six real-world issues. Through their own inquiry, students will be able to appreciate both the values and limitations of economic models in explaining real-world economic behaviour and outcomes. By focusing on the six real-world issues through the nine key concepts (scarcity, choice, efficiency, equity, economic well-being, sustainability, change, interdependence and intervention), students of the economics course will develop the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes that will encourage them to act responsibly as global citizens.",

The contribution and the interaction of the three approaches are understood through the four options in the course, focusing on areas of applied psychology: abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, health psychology, and the psychology of relationships. The options provide an opportunity to take what is learned from the study of the approaches to psychology and apply it to specific lines of inquiry. Psychologists employ a range of research methods, both qualitative and quantitative, to test their observations and hypotheses. DP psychology promotes an understanding of the various approaches to research and how they are used to critically reflect on the evidence as well as assist in the design, implementation, analysis, and evaluation of the students' investigations.

The course places emphasis on comparative perspectives that make cultural assumptions explicit and contributes to an understanding of contemporary real-world issues such as war and conflict, the environment, poverty, injustice, and human rights. Social and cultural anthropology is distinct from other social sciences in its research tradition of participant observation and in-depth, empirical study of social groups. Areas of anthropological inquiry in this course are: belonging; classifying the world; communication, expression and technology; conflict; development; health, illness, and healing; movement, time, and space; production, exchange, and consumption; and the body. These areas are explored through the key anthropological concepts of belief and knowledge, change, culture, identity, materiality, power, social relations, society, and symbolism. The course engages students with the concepts, methods, language, and theories of the discipline. At the heart is the practice of anthropologists and the insights they produce in the form of ethnographic material. Through authentic anthropological practice, students engage with anthropological approaches and develop critical, reflexive knowledge. It contributes a distinctive approach to intercultural awareness and understanding, which embodies the essence of an IB education and fosters the development of globally aware, internationally minded, and ethically sensitive citizens.",

		"description": "The IB Diploma Programme visual arts course encourages students to challenge their own creative and cultural expectations and boundaries. It is a thought-provoking course in which students develop analytical skills in problem-solving and divergent thinking, while working towards technical proficiency and confidence as art-makers. In addition to exploring and comparing visual arts from different perspectives and in different contexts, students are expected to engage in, experiment with, and critically reflect upon a wide range of contemporary practices and media. The course is designed for students who want to go on to study visual arts in higher education as well as for those who are seeking lifelong enrichment through visual arts. The role of visual arts teachers should be to actively and carefully organize learning experiences for the students, directing their study to enable them to reach their potential and satisfy the demands of the course. Students should be empowered to become autonomous, informed, and skilled visual artists.",

	"Literature And Performance": {
		"firstAssessment": "2015",
		"lastAssessment": "2023",
		"description": "Literature and performance is an interdisciplinary synthesis of literature and theatre. It brings together literary analysis, based on close reading, critical writing, and discussion, with practical and aesthetic elements of theatre. In this course, students engage with a range of literary works, perform dramatic texts, and transform texts into realized performances. The course is grounded in knowledge, skills, and processes associated with the individual disciplines while developing interdisciplinary understandings generated from the interactions between literature and performance. Literature and performance is only available as a standard level (SL) course. Literature and performance is one of the three Diploma Programme (DP) courses grounded in the study of language and literature. Expectations of language usage, the level of analysis, and critical reflection are the same across the three studies in language and literature courses. Yet literature and performance is unique in that it asks students to integrate understandings from two disciplines to develop further insight and create products that would not be possible within the single disciplines alone. Investigating a literary text through performance provides students with a unique perspective on the text; likewise, grounding a theatrical performance in literary understanding provides students with deeper sensitivity to the process of theatre-making. As an interdisciplinary course, literature and performance shares the course aims of both studies in language and literature and arts subjects.",

	"Theory Of Knowledge": {
		"description": "The theory of knowledge (TOK) course plays a special role in the DP by providing an opportunity for students to reflect on the nature, scope and limitations of knowledge and the process of knowing. In this way, the main focus of TOK is not on students acquiring new knowledge but on helping students to reflect on, and put into perspective, what they already know. TOK underpins and helps to unite the subjects that students encounter in the rest of their DP studies. It engages students in explicit reflection on how knowledge is arrived at in different disciplines and areas of knowledge, on what these areas have in common and the differences between them.",

	"Extended Essay": {
		"description": "The extended essay is a compulsory, externally assessed piece of independent research into a topic chosen by the student and presented as a formal piece of academic writing. The extended essay is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery, and creativity while engaging students in personal research. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing of up to 4,000 words in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned, coherent, and appropriate manner. Students are guided through the process of research and writing by an assigned supervisor (a teacher in the school). All students undertake three mandatory reflection sessions with their supervisor, including a short interview, or viva voce, following the completion of the extended essay. Extended essay topics may be chosen from a list of approved DP subjects—normally one of the student’s six chosen subjects for the IB diploma or the world studies option. World studies provides students with the opportunity to carry out an in-depth interdisciplinary study of an issue of contemporary global significance, using two IB disciplines."

	"Creativity, Activity, Service": {
		"description": "Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the DP, designed to strengthen and extend students' personal and interpersonal learning from the Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Programme (MYP). CAS is organized around the three strands of creativity, activity, and service, each defined as follows: Creativity involves exploring and extending ideas leading to an original or interpretive product or performance. Activity encompasses physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle. Service entails collaborative and reciprocal engagement with the community in response to an authentic need. A CAS experience is a specific event in which the student engages with one or more of the three CAS strands. It can be a single event or an extended series of events. A CAS project is a collaborative series of sequential CAS experiences lasting at least one month. Typically, a student's CAS program combines planned/unplanned singular and ongoing experiences. All are valuable and may lead to personal development. However, a meaningful CAS program must be more than just a series of unplanned/singular experiences. Students must be involved in at least one CAS project during the program."
